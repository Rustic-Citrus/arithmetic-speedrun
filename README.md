# Arithmetic Speed Run!

## Introduction

This is a simple maths game that I made using Python. 

The goal is to solve the multiplication equations as quickly as possible. 
There are several difficulty levels, ranging from single-digit to 
four-digit multiplication.

When you finish the round, you can save your score with a unique username, 
which you could then use to compete with others.
