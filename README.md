# Multiplication Speed Run!

## Introduction

This is a simple maths game that I made using Python. 

The goal is to solve the multiplication equations as quickly as possible. 
There are several difficulty levels, ranging from single-digit to 
four-digit multiplication.

When you finish the round, you can save your score with a unique username, 
which you could then use to compete with others.

## Upcoming Changes

- At the moment, there is no user interface, but it would cool if it 
looked a little bit more user-friendly. I'd like to continue trying to use 
Python, so I'd have to try and learn how to do it that way.
- A simple change that'd be cool to add would be to allow the user to 
choose the number of problems they want to do.
- I think I should add a few comments to explain my code in the future. At 
the moment, it might be a bit hard to read.
- I don't really like "problems.py". There's got to be a better name.
- When "main.py" finishes running, it often raises an OSError. Ideally, the 
program should close cleanly, without raising exceptions.

## Thanks

Thank you for showing an interest in my little game! 
If you tried it, I hope it worked for you without errors. 
If it didn't, please let me know and I'll try and fix it.
