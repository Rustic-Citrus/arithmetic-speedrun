# Arithmetic Speedrun!

## Introduction

This is a simple maths game that I made using Python. 

The goal is to solve as many arithmetic equations as quickly as possible, and
in doing so, help the user improve their core mathematical skills. 

There are several difficulty levels, ranging from single-digit to three-digit 
multiplication.

When you finish the round, you can save your score with a unique username, 
which you can then use to track your progress over time or to compete with 
others.
