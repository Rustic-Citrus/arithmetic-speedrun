## Introduction

**Date**: 2024-02-07

After having successfully made Arithmetic Speedrun, I realised that I had only done a fraction of the work. While it is true the app does what it was supposed to do (i.e. it can be used to practice your basic arithmetic), the problem is that the project doesn't actually demonstrate that I can develop software. I haven't shown how I planned the app. I haven't shown how I took into consideration implementing some features and not including others. Therefore, I haven't actually shown that I know how to develop software.

In all honesty, I never set out a formal plan to make Arithmetic Speedrun. It was a way for me to practice writing Python, and I was curious how to make a standalone application with a GUI, that was all. Now I look back at the result, and I'm rather pleased with it. Granted, it's not particularly revolutionary, but it does what it says on the tin.

So it seems the next step for Arithmetic Speedrun will be to remake Arithmetic Speedrun. That is, to remake it on paper, to redesign it, to think about how I would make it, if I hadn't already made it. Then, should the paper-version differ significantly from the actual version, remake it in reality.

I have a feeling that it will.
